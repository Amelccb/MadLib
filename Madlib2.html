        <h1> Analysis: Recent headlines reveal the two truths about <span class="Noun">social media</span></h1>
  
        <h2>Analysis by Oli Dar, CNN Business</h2>
      
        <h3>Updated 12:24 AM ET, FRI October 22, 2021</h3>
   
        <h4> (CNN Business)-<em>A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here</em>.</h5> 

        <p>Two things have been made even more apparent in recent days: That <span class="Noun">social media </span> can be exceptionally <span class="Adjective">corrosive</span> to <span class="Noun">society </span> and that <span class="Noun">people </span> will still continue to use the <span class="Noun">products </span> in mind-boggling numbers. The storm of recent headlines might be <span class="Verb">tarnishing</span> the reputation of <span class="Noun">Facebook</span> and some of the other industry <span class="Noun">giants</span>, but the numbers these <span class="Noun">companies</span> are reporting in their earnings reports show that <span class="Noun">people</span> will continue to use their <span class="Noun">products</span> regardless.</p>

        <p>Yes, there is a lot of <span class="Verb">huffing</span> and <span class="Verb">puffing</span> going on right now about how <span class="Adjective">dangerous</span> these <span class="Noun">products</span> are, how <span class="Adjective">unethical</span> they behave, how for years they have <span class="Verb">poisoned</span> the public conversation with <span class="Noun">hate </span> and <span class="Noun">misinformation</span> and outright <span class="Noun">lies</span> and <span class="Noun"> conspiracy theories</span>. And yet, it must be asked: Has that compelled sizable numbers of users to logoff? To hit the <span class="Noun">delete button</span>? To walk away from the toxicity?</p>
  
        <p>All evidence points to no. <span class="Noun">People</span> continue to use these <span class="Noun">platforms</span> while also understanding how <span class="Adjective">destructive</span> they can be. Seriously, ask yourself: Are you still <span class="Verb">scrolling</span> through <span class="Noun">Facebook</span>? Double-<span class="Verb">tapping</span> photos on <span class="Noun">Instagram</span>? <span class="Verb">Watching</span> <span class="Noun">videos</span> on <span class="Noun">YouTube</span>? A betting <span class="Noun">man</span> would be unwise to guess that you have abandoned the <span class="Noun">online universes</span> that these <span class="Noun">companies</span> have constructed. And you're not alone...</p>
